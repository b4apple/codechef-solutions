### Codechef Solutions

Hi ! I am Aritro Shome, better known on [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/users/skaadin) as skaadin. 

This repository contains code for some of the problems.

To find the page of the problem, type codechef.com/_file-name-without-extension-in-upper-case_

The above format doesn't work for some contests, so feel free to hunt a bit !

The build tools are exclusively for windows :)

Prerequisites : 

 - g++.exe (MinGW) or any other C++ compiler supporting atleast C++14
 - Sublime Text Editor (only if you use the batch scripts)

Hope this repo helps !

NOTE : template.cpp, as the name suggests is not a problem, its a template.

FEEL FREE TO FORK AND HELP ME !
